# JumpCut Hiring Project

I have developed this project using ASP.NET with MVC, C# as server side language and SQL server as database. This project does not interact directly with database at any level. <b>All of its database level operations are being done by REST API specially developed for this project.</b>

This project has below-mentioned pages:
<ol>
  <li>Signup
  <li>Login
  <li>Password Reset Request
  <li>Password Reset
</ol>
